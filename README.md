# New York State Drive Clean
### By: Shireen Talaat
## Introduction
New York Stateâ€™s Charge NY initiative offers electric car buyers the Drive Clean Rebate of up to $2,000 for new car purchases or leases. The rebate amount depends on the battery-only range of each vehicle. Dealers enrolled in the program deduct the eligible amount from the vehicle price at the point of sale and then submit a rebate application with NYSERDA. This dataset includes all completed rebate applications as of the data through date. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) offers objective information and analysis, innovative programs, technical expertise, and support to help New Yorkers increase energy efficiency, save money, use renewable energy, and accelerate economic growth. Reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

- What is the most popular make?
- What is the preferred car for each county?
- What is the Annual GHG Emissions Reductions (MT CO2e) per car make?
- What is the Annual Petroleum Reductions (gallons) per car make?
- What is the Annual GHG Emissions Reductions (MT CO2e) per County?
- What is the Annual Petroleum Reductions (gallons) per County?
- Top Counties that are using Electric Vehicle.
- Rebate Amount in (USD) Vs Transaction Type.
- Number of EV Type per Make
- Annual GHG Emissions Reductions in (MT CO2e) per Make and EV Type
- Annual Petroleum Reductions in (gallons) per Make and EV type
